## Projects

This project involves building a scalable ETL pipeline using Apache Spark and Python. I will use Airflow to orchestrate the ETL process, and dbt for managing transformations. The pipeline will extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a clean and structured format, and load it into a cloud data warehouse (like BigQuery or AWS Redshift).

This project focuses on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis to help businesses understand customer behavior and spending patterns. By analyzing metrics like Total Purchase, Frequency, and CLV, it uncovers insights into high-value customers and their purchasing behavior. The goal is to offer actionable insights for enhancing customer retention, optimizing marketing, and boosting profitability. The project uses R Studio for the analysis.

Develop a machine learning model to predict equipment failures in a manufacturing plant. The dataset should contain machine sensor readings over time, and my task is to predict when maintenance is required before failure occurs. This project will leverage time series analysis, regression models, and feature engineering.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/lewis-hue/lewis_page/blob/main/databricks.png"> **[Business Intelligence (BI): Sales Forecasting Dashboard (Databricks)](https://github.com/lewis-hue/BusinessIntelligence.git)**

This project demonstrates a comprehensive sales data analysis using **SQL** within **Databricks** on **Microsoft Azure**. The analysis covers product-level revenue, units sold, store performance, and geographic trends. A robust **ETL pipeline** was developed in Databricks to ingest and process transactional sales data across countries and stores. Key business insights were visualized via interactive dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

**Skills & Tools:** SQL, Databricks, Microsoft Azure, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Sales Analytics, ETL Pipelines, Dashboarding, Retail Analytics

Implement an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process using dbt (Data Build Tool) to load raw data from BigQuery into a data warehouse and then transform it for business intelligence (BI) analysis. Use Python for preprocessing, and visualize the results in Power BI or Tableau.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/phase1.jpg"> **[Big Data Analytics: Real-Time Data Processing with Apache Spark](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis)** 

In this project, I will build a real-time analytics pipeline using Apache Spark and Kafka. The pipeline will process real-time data, such as user activity logs, and generate immediate insights, such as active users, popular products, or sentiment scores from reviews.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/gdp.jpg"> **[Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Predicting-GDP-of-India)**

Build a sentiment analysis model to determine customer satisfaction from their reviews on an e-commerce platform. I will preprocess the text data, use NLP techniques like tokenization and vectorization, and build a classification model to categorize reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
