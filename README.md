## Projects

In this project, I used survival analysis to study customer churn likelihood over time and implemented a Random Forest model to predict churn. The model was deployed as a Flask web application on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)

The objective of this project is to analyze over 3 million grocery orders and predict which previously purchased items will be included in a customer's next order. I performed customer segmentation and affinity analysis to uncover user purchase patterns.

This project involves building a hybrid-filtering recommendation system that suggests news articles based on a userâ€™s reading history (collaborative filtering) and the content similarity of the articles and tweets (content-based filtering).

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/airplane.jpeg"> **[Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Engine](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Predictive-Maintenance-of-Aircraft-Engine)**

In this project, I used models like RNN, LSTM, and 1D-CNN to predict aircraft engine failure 50 cycles ahead of time. I performed feature importance analysis using sensitivity and SHAP values and applied exponential degradation models to predict the remaining engine life.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/960x0.jpg"> **[Wind Turbine Power Curve Estimation](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Wind-Turbine-Power-Curve-Estimation)**

This project focuses on estimating the power curve of an on-shore wind turbine. Using regression techniques, I applied nonlinear tree-based methods such as XGBoost, which were optimized using GridSearchCV to achieve the lowest test RMSE of 6.404.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/phase1.jpg"> **[Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis)** 

The objective of this project was to identify in-control and out-of-control data points for setting up distribution parameters in manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and used Hotelling's T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to establish mean and variance matrices.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/gdp.jpg"> **[What's the GDP of India?](https://github.com/lewismuguna/Predicting-GDP-of-India)**

In this project, I performed a predictive analysis of Indiaâ€™s GDP based on socio-economic factors. After comparing several models, I implemented Stepwise Regression, resulting in a 5.7% test MSE.
